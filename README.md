These are the configs I use on my Arch Linux installation at home. They can be use and changed as much or as little as you please

## Usage
To quickly get started, clone this repo and run the setup scripts.

    git clone https://github.com/frebib/dotfiles.git ~/.config/dotfiles
    cd ~/.config/dotfiles

To install all of my packages & programs, run the setup script:

    scripts/setup.sh

To link all the configuration files, run the init-dotfiles script:
**Be warned that this will destroy your current configs without warning**

    scripts/init-dotfiles.sh
